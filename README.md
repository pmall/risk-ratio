# Spread Scanner

This is a CLI tool designed to help analyze options spreads, calculate probabilities, and provide snapshots of market data.

## üéØ Core Concept

This tool leverages the collective wisdom embedded in implied volatility to provide more accurate, probabilistic assessments of price movements and position risks. It uses a polynomial regression model to fit a smooth curve to the market's implied volatility smile, ensuring a robust and continuous probability distribution.

## ‚ú® Features

This CLI tool provides the following commands:

- `list-expirations`: Lists available expiration dates for a given instrument.
- `snapshot`: Fetches and displays the raw options chain data for a specific instrument and expiration.
- `probabilities`: Computes and displays the probabilistic price distribution for an underlying asset at a given expiration.
- `analyze-spread`: Analyzes a single, user-defined vertical spread, providing detailed risk/reward and probabilistic metrics.

## üî¨ Methodology

To ensure a smooth and consistent probability curve and accurate probabilistic calculations, the tool implements the following process:

1.  **Fetch Data**: It retrieves the full option chain (strikes, and implied volatilities) for a given asset and expiration.
2.  **Fit Volatility Smile**: It performs a 2nd-degree polynomial regression on the implied volatilities as a function of their log-moneyness (`log(strike/current_price)`). This fits a smooth curve to the raw market data, accounting for the volatility smile/skew.
3.  **Generate Dense Probability Grid**: Using the fitted volatility model, it generates a dense grid of price points (not just strike prices) and calculates their cumulative probabilities. This provides a more accurate representation of the continuous probability distribution.
4.  **Calculate Probabilities**: It uses this smoothed volatility model to calculate the cumulative probability (`P(price <= K)`) for any given price, resulting in a robust and continuous probability distribution.

This method allows for the accurate pricing of any price, not just those actively traded, and forms a solid basis for calculating expected returns and losses for any options position.

## üöÄ Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd spread-scanner
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root based on `.env.example` (if applicable):
    ```
    # .env.example
    DERIBIT_API_URL=https://www.deribit.com/api/v2
    ```
    Copy this content to a new file named `.env`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Application-wide configuration values are defined in `src/config.ts`. This file centralizes settings for API endpoints and filtering options.

```typescript
export const config = {
  deribit: {
    apiUrl: process.env.DERIBIT_API_URL || "https://www.deribit.com/api/v2",
  },
};
```

You can modify these values directly in `src/config.ts` to adjust the behavior of the CLI tool.

## üí° Usage Examples

All commands are run using `npm run cli -- <command> [arguments] [options]`.

### 1. `list-expirations`

Lists available expiration dates for a given instrument.

```bash
npm run cli -- list-expirations deribit SOL-USDC
```

Example Output:

```
Available expirations for SOL-USDC from deribit:
2025-09-03
2025-09-04
2025-09-05
...
```

### 2. `snapshot`

Fetches and displays the raw options chain data for a specific instrument and expiration.

```bash
npm run cli -- snapshot deribit SOL-USDC 2025-09-03
```

Example Output (truncated):

```
Option chain for SOL-USDC on 2025-09-03 from deribit:
{
  strike: 176,
  type: 'call',
  impliedVolatility: 117.19,
  volume: 0,
  openInterest: 0,
  bidPrice: 0,
  askPrice: 0,
  lastPrice: 0,
  expiration: '2025-09-03T08:00:00.000Z',
  instrument_name: 'SOL_USDC-3SEP25-176-C'
}
...
```

### 3. `probabilities`

Computes and displays the probabilistic price distribution for an underlying asset at a given expiration, specifically for the available strike prices.

```bash
npm run cli -- probabilities deribit SOL-USDC 2025-09-03
```

Example Output (truncated):

```
Analyzing SOL-USDC options for expiration: 2025-09-03 from deribit:
Current Price: 175.20
Total Options: 104
Filtered Options: 104

Price Probability Distribution:
Strike   P(<=K)    1-P(<=K)
140.00   0.1898    0.8102
150.00   0.2933    0.7067
160.00   0.4015    0.5985
170.00   0.5089    0.4911
180.00   0.6123    0.3877
190.00   0.7088    0.2912
200.00   0.7939    0.2061
...
```

### 4. `analyze-spread`

Analyzes a single, user-defined vertical spread, providing detailed risk/reward and probabilistic metrics.

- **Usage:**

  ```bash
  npm run cli -- analyze-spread <source> <instrument> <expiration> --type <call|put> --strikes <k1,k2> --side <debit|credit>
  ```

  - `<source>`: Data source (e.g., `deribit`).
  - `<instrument>`: Instrument to analyze (e.g., `SOL-USDC`).
  - `<expiration>`: Expiration date (YYYY-MM-DD).
  - `--type <call|put>`: **(Required)** Type of the spread's options.
  - `--strikes <k1,k2>`: **(Required)** The two strike prices, comma-separated (e.g., `100,110`).
  - `--side <debit|credit>`: **(Required)** Whether the spread is a debit or credit strategy.

- **Output Metrics:**
  The command provides a comprehensive analysis including:
  - **Net Premium:** The raw premium paid (debit) or received (credit) for the spread.
  - **Max Profit / Max Loss:** The maximum possible profit and loss for the trade, accounting for the premium.
  - **Expected Payoff at Expiration / Expected Loss at Expiration:** The probability-weighted intrinsic value of the spread at expiration, _before_ accounting for the premium.
  - **Expected PnL:** The overall expected profit or loss of the trade, accounting for the premium. This is the most direct measure of the trade's expected financial outcome.
  - **Risk/Reward Ratio:** The ratio of expected payoff/loss to premium/risk.
  - **Probability of Profit:** The chance that the spread will expire profitably.
  - **Break-Even Price:** The underlying price at which the trade neither makes nor loses money.

## üíª Technology Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js (for CLI)
- **Package Manager**: npm

## üîÆ Future Extensions

This project is designed with extensibility in mind. Future phases include:
